          <h4>Ratatouille Once Said: "Anyone can cook"</h4>
          <p>After Remy returns to help Linguini, Linguini finally reveals to the rest of the kitchen staff the truth that Remy is responsible for the restaurant’s renewed success. Everyone quits. Remy’s family rallies to help him and Linguini serve the guests—and Anton. Colette returns and helps Remy create a special dish of ratatouille for Anton, who loves it and demands to meet the cook.</p>

          <h5>Gusteau</h5>
          <p>But the health inspector shuts Gusteau’s down due to a rat infestation. With Anton backing them, Remy, Linguini, and Colette open a new restaurant. This is a lovely example of how a little “bittersweet” can keep a happy ending from being too pat. Everyone gets what they want, but there are still consequences for their actions.</p>

          <h6>Remy's Recipe </h6>
          <p>Skinner challenges Linguini to make a special order for customers who want something “new.” Remy successfully—and to everyone’s surprise—creates something new and marvelous, and soon everyone is ordering it. Remy can now move out of his reaction phase in the first half and instead begin taking action within the kitchen.</p>
